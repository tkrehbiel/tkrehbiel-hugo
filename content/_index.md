Hi! It looks like I've finally gotten around to fixing this domain. I'm a software developer in Virginia. I currently work remotely for a Fortune 500 software company on the west coast.

## Timeline

- 1980s
  - TRS-80 Color Computer

  - C#/VB .NET
- 2021
  - Linux/MacOS
  - Golang/Java/Python/AWS

## Places You're More Likely To Find Me

- [Endgame Viable](https://endgameviable.com/). Blog posts about games and/or stuff I'm doing roughly twice a month.
- [Microblog](https://gts.endgameviable.com/@ultrviolet). Short, unimportant thoughts posted many times a week.
- [YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/@endgameviable). Games I play, automatically uploaded nightly.
- [Github](https://github.com/tkrehbiel). Hobby software projects I work on occasionally.

P.S. There used to be a lot of blog posts from 2006-2012 at this domain which are probably broken now. I'm trying to figure out how to redirect the old links to a new site.
